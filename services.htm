        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Safety Critical Systems Require Expert Teams</h2>
        <h3>Project Inception</h2>
        <p>Before committing resources to project design and implementation, Newbridge can assist in scoping the effort required for the necessary safety critical activities. We can assist in task estimates and schedules, for products targeting the  Commercial, Military or International sectors.</p>
        <h3>On-Going Project Involvement</h2>
        <p>As projects progress, tasks addressing the safety-criticality aspects will need to be performed, these include:</p>
        <ul class="p-size">
                <li>Creation of Plans, Standards and Checklists</li>
                <li>Infrastructure setup and maintenance</li>
                <li>Requirements Management</li>
                <li>Verification and Validation activities (System and Unit Test creation, execution and cross-reference maintenance)</li>
                <li>Interface with Certification Authority</li>
                <li>On-going Quality Assurance</li>
        </ul>    
        <h3>Manufacture and Change Control</h2>
        <p>Safety aspects continue after implementation, into the manufacturing process and as changes are required through the life of the product. It is imperative the necessary processes and controls are incorporated once the product has been implemented and tested, to fulfill the certifying authorities</p>
        <h3>International Standards and Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Whether you are a US company looking to market your products abroad, or a foreign company seeking a share in the U.S. market, Newbridge Technical can assist you in navigating the appropriate guidelines and standards to achieve presence in the U.S. or a foreign country.</p>
